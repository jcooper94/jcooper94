Media Converter
OSI Layer 1 Device
Extends a copper wire over a long dinstance
(convert copper to fiber and then back again to copper)
Converting fiber to a copper port
Almost always powered

Transceiver
Transmitter and receiver (usually in a single component)
Provides a modular interface (You can swap out the transceiver that matches your network)

Duplex Communication
(Two Fibers)

Bi-Directional (BiDi) transceivers
Traffic in both directions with a single fiber
Use two different wavelengths
Reduce number of fiber runs by half

SFP and SFP+
(Small Form-factor Pluggable)
Commonly used to provide 1gbit fiber

SFP+ for 10gbit

QSFP:
4 channel SFP = FOUR 1 gbit = 4gbits per SFP

QSFP+:
Four channel SFP+ = Four 10 gbit/sec = 40gbit/sec

Bi-Directional (BiDi) QSFP and QSFP+
