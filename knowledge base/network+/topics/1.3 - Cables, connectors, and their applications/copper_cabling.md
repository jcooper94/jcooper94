# Copper

## Twisted Pair Copper Cabling

Balance pair operation:
Two wires with equal and opposite signals
Transmit+, Transmit-/Receive+, Receive-

The twist keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference
The opposite signals are compared on the other end

Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates
