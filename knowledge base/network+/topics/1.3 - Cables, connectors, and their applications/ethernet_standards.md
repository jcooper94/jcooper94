Ethernet:
Modern ethernet uses twisted pair copper or fiber

BASE(baseband)
Single frequency using the entire medium

Broadband:
Uses many frequencies, sharing the medium

10 and 100 Megabit Ethernet:

10BASE-T (twisted pair):
Two pairs
Cegeoryy 3 cable minumum
100 meter maximum dinstance

100BASE-TX
Fast Ethernet
Two Pair
Category 5 minimum
100 meter maximum distances

1000BASE-T
Gigabit Ethernet over Categor 5
4 pair balanced twisted pair
Cat 5 is deprecated, cate 5e is used in its place
100 meter maximum distance

10GBASE-T
10 Gig Ethernet over copper
4 pair balanced twisted pair
Frequency use of 500mhz in comparison to 125mhz on gigabit ethernet 

Cat 6

WDM
(Wavelength-Division Multiplexing)
Bidirectional communication over a single strand of fiber
