# Network Toplogies
Physical layout of a building or campus.  Assists in understanding of data flow.

## Star
Hube and spoke
Used in most large and small networks
All devices are connected to a central device
Switched ethernet networks, switch is in the middle.

## Ring
Used in many popular topologies
Still used in many :
Metro Area Networks (MANs)
Wide Area Networks (WANs)

## Bus
Early local area networks
Coaxial cable was the bus
Uses one cable for entire network
On break in the link disabled the entire network
Controller Area Network:
CAN bus, used to connect sensors and controller inside vehicles.

## Mesh
Multiple links to the same place
Fully connected
Partially connected
Provides redundancy, fault-tolerance, and load balancing.
Used in most wide area networks

## Hybrid
A combination of one or more physical topologies
Most networks are hybrid

## Wireless
Infastructure mode:
all devices communicate through an access point

Ad hoc networking mode:
No pre-existing infastructure
Devices communicate amongst themselves

Mesh:
Ad hoc devices work together to form a mesh "cloud"
Self form and self heal
