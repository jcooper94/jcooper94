# Satellite networking
Communicate to satellite
50mbits down, 3 mbits up
High Latency - 250ms up, 250ms down
High Frequency - 2ghz
Line of sight, and rain fade effect the signal

# Copper
Extensive installations
Relatively inexpensive
Easy to install and maintain

Limited bandwidth availibility

Wide area networks
Cable modem, dsl

Often combined with fiber
Copper on the local network, fiber for the backbone

# DSL
ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
Uses telephone lines we already have present
Download speed is faster than the upload speed
200mbps downstream / 20 mbps upstream
Faster speeds if you are closer to central isp office

# Cable Broadband
Transmission across mupltiple frequencies
Different traffic types
DOCSIS (data over cable service interface specification)

# Fiber
High speed data communication
Uses frequencies of light
Higher installation cost than copper
Equipment is more costly
More difficult to repair
Communicate over long distances
