# Personal Linux Setup and Backup

This repository serves as my personal backup for my current Linux setup, including an Ansible playbook and notes about various programs and configurations. In case my laptop encounters issues or needs reinstallation, I've included an Ansible playbook for automated setup.

## Operating System
I use either Arch Linux or Debian (minimal installation) as my base OS.

## Desktop Environment
I alternate between two desktop environments:

1. **GNOME Core**: A minimal version of GNOME with essential components.
2. **DWM (Dynamic Window Manager)**: A lightweight, tiling window manager.

## Terminal Font
I prefer the **Ubuntu Mono** terminal font for its readability and clean appearance.

## Software Selection
Here are the programs I rely on:

- **Firefox**: My primary web browser.
- **VLC**: For multimedia playback.
- **VSCodium**: An open-source variant of Visual Studio Code.
- **GIMP**: The GNU Image Manipulation Program for graphic editing.
- **Spotify Downloader**: To save Spotify tracks locally.
- **LibreOffice Writer**: For word processing and document creation.

## Proprietary Software
While I strive to use only Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) recommended by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), I make exceptions for the following proprietary tools:

- **Spotify**: Essential for music streaming.
- **Discord**: For communication and community interaction.

## Command-Line Tools
I rely on several CLI tools for efficiency:

- **tmux**: Terminal multiplexer for managing multiple sessions.
- **vim**: My preferred text editor.
- **cmatrix**: A fun matrix screensaver.
- **screenfetch**: Displays system information in the terminal.
- **lsd**: A modern `ls` command with color and icons.
- **cpufetch**: Shows CPU information.
- **bpytop**: A resource monitor and process viewer.
