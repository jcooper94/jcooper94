Navigating a lifelong journey with autoimmune issues, I was forced to educate myself and explore avenues to enhance cognition, memory, and mood. The discovery of nootropics has profoundly impacted my life. From battling poor lifestyle choices, inadequate sleep, and excessive weight, my transformation was triggered by insights shared by Joe Rogan, Andrew Huberman, and Biohackers. It was a particular episode of the Joe Rogan Experience with Andrew Huberman, a professor whose wisdom became a catalyst for a complete 180-degree shift in both physical and mental health.

Previously a 60-pound overweight individual engrossed in World of Warcraft, I evolved into someone weighing 165 pounds, jogging 6 miles a day, and experiencing a substantial boost in cognitive abilities. Despite inherent intelligence, autoimmune issues led to brain fog, anxiety, depression, and fatigue due to inflammation caused by my lifestyle.

Heres some information that helped me:

1. **Understanding Nootropics:**
   - Nootropics act as cognitive enhancers, ranging from prescription medications to dietary supplements and natural compounds.
   - Examples include caffeine, L-Theanine, Omega-3, Vitamin D3, Magnesium L Threonate, Creatine, Racetams (e.g., Aniracetam), Noopept, and Choline Sources like Citicholine or Alpha GPC.

2. **Ensuring Quality:**
   - When purchasing supplements or nootropics, insist on third-party lab testing to guarantee cleanliness and quality.
   - Be cautious when buying from platforms like Amazon, considering different forms and bioavailability.

3. **Holistic Well-Being:**
   - No single substance can make you feel invincible; holistic well-being involves attention to sleep, diet, exercise, and nootropic supplementation.

4. **Impact of B Vitamins:**
   - Methylated forms of B Vitamins, particularly B12, significantly impacted my well-being.
   - Individuals with the MTHFR C677T gene mutation affecting B12 and Folic Acid conversion may benefit from Methylated B Vitamin Complex.
